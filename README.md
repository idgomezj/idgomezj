      A social performance metrics framework for sustainable manufacturing
    </a>
  </p>

  *International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering ¬∑ May 24, 2021*

  Manufacturing companies are under constant pressure from stakeholders to achieve higher sustainability levels, especially in terms of environmental and social aspects. Although social performance is not a new topic in operations management, it is the least explored pillar of the triple bottom-line approach. Metrics for the assessment of social performance levels remain scarce, which limits those companies that are willing to involve them in decision-making processes. This situation can be attributed to the difficulty of finding sufficiently comparable, widespread, and quantifiable social metrics. Therefore, the present study aims to provide a broader perspective of social performance, including both internal and external metrics. With the goal of providing a more holistic performance assessment, and based on findings present in the current literature, a social performance metrics framework is proposed. The framework proposes a three-layer approach, which allows companies to strengthen their social performance evaluation, based on internal metrics, while dealing with more complex external metrics.

      Lean manufacturing and sustainable performance: Trends and future challenges
    </a>
  </p>

  *Journal of Cleaner Production ¬∑ Oct 10, 2018*

  Lean manufacturing has proven its positive effects on operational and economic performance in multiple cases. However, growing consciousness regarding sustainability and the Triple Bottom Line approach requires an integral performance based on three main goals: economic growth, environmental preservation, and social responsibility. Given the relevance that lean manufacturing has acquired, it is
important to understand its effects on sustainability. Thus, this paper presents a literature review, discussing the most relevant findings of research in this sphere, and identifying current trends concerning the effect of lean manufacturing on sustainable performance. A total of 69 papers were reviewed, following a five-step synthesis methodology. Common and contrasting results were categorized according to each pillar of the triple bottom line, which allowed for the identification of not only growing research trends, but also of knowledge gaps. Unlike previous literature reviews, this study approaches lean manufacturing's effect on performance from a multidimensional point of view, accounting for all three triple bottom line pillars. It contributes on the identification of the main current research trends, which favors branches: one which supports complementary interactions between lean manufacturing and all three pillars of the triple bottom line, and the other, which evidences trade-offs among them. According to the results of the review, knowledge gaps on the matter remain, which require further research.

      Multicriteria methodology for decoupling point placement in manufacturing systems
    </a>
  </p>


  *INGENIER√çA Y DESARROLLO ¬∑ Jan 1, 2017*

  Synchronization  between  production  scheduling  and  real  demand  is  an  issue  of  great  concern  for  production  practitioners  and  academics.  Put  in  a  nutshell,  the  solution  requires  the  placement  of  a  decoupling  point in order to get a trade-off between efficiency and flexibility. In the context of a postponement production strategy, a decoupling point is an inventory buffer to create independence between the process and final demand. Upstream of the decoupling point, the process is managed under a make-to-stock approach; in contrast, downstream operations meet the final demand under a make-to-order approach. In this sense, the present paper proposes a multicriteria methodology to locate decoupling points in manufacturing systems. The methodology consists of two stages, with two and three steps respectively. In the first stage, the decision criteria and alternative for decoupling points are chosen. In the second one, the final decoupling point placement is determined. By applying the methodology in a metalworking company, the location of the decoupling points for nine production lines was obtained.

  Like any research process, the results present limitations that must be mentioned and which can also inspire future research. It is emphasized that the importance of the experts' participation in this process warrants assessing their level of expertise and knowledge to identify the relevance of their involvement in decision-making. Nevertheless, it must be considered that the methodology design requires that experts' participation be in specific tasks. Therefore, the assessment cannot be based on a general method for everyone but must be an individualized process in which expertise is measured according to the tasks they are involved in.
